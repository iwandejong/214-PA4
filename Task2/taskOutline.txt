We still need support for the older SQL statements like "SELECT * FROM table" where as the new SQL statement standard would be "FROM table SELECT *"

The older SQL needs to adapt to the new SQL standard but without altering the original statements (legacy code tends to be coupled and difficult to alter).

The adaptee (service) would be the incompatible class, therefore the old SQL statements.

The adapter would be the compatible class with which the Client may interact. This would be the new SQL statements
